# To Do List

- [] Case Study
- [x] Find music .mp3 files
- [x] Find sound effects, .mp3 files
- [x] Loading all music to single variables & creating a TAB to group this code (also illustrate that the local variables are garbage collected)
- [x] loading all sound effects to single variables
- [x] concatenating strings
  - [x] pathway from sketch
  - [x] String variables from copy-and-pasted file lists in WiNDOWS Folder
  - [x] advanced introductory: list of music files .mp3, as populated from meta data from .mp3 files (CAUTION: this is an impossible ask, can you explain why)
- [x] creating keyboard short cuts to play sound effects and quit
- [x] design of music buttons based on rect(), triangle(), and ellipse()
  - [] design buttons in order, illustrate how stop designs rest: stop, pause, play, mute, skip forward in seconds, skip reverse in seconds, next song, previous song, three loops, and a shuffle (shapes in fast forward and next illustrate what actually happens)
  - [] Using the referent of the side length of the STOP button, design all layout rect() of all the other buttons
  - [] Design all buttons
- [x] layout code groupings so keyPressed() does the same as mousePressed()
- [] Pseudocode all buttons & demonstrate one way of coding
  - [] Single Line IF
  - [] Multiple Line IF
  - [] IF - ELSE
  - IF - ELSE IF - ELSE
  - [] ADVANCED: Next and Previous Songs require arrays, will be done later
- [] Code "Single" Song Buttons
  - [] Simple Play Buttons, require change to array and index (computer tracks alpha numeric variable naming)
  - [] Play-Pause
  - [] Stop
  - [] Mute
  - [] Fast Forward
  - [] Fast Rewind
  - [] Use following code ... which means these buttons are fancy ...
    - .isPlaying()
    - .isMuted()
    - .pause()
    - .rewind()
    - .play(), but Auto Play is better (see below)
    - . unmute()
    - .mute()
    - .skip(+/-milliSeconds)
- [] Code "Multiple" Song Buttons
  - [] Introduce Array and Index from alpha numeric numbering
  - [] Auto Play Button (used instead of a play button)
  - [] Next Button
  - [] Previous Button
- [] Advanced Buttons
  - [] Loop Current Song Infinitely
  - [] Loop Play List
  - [] Shuffle Play List



CONTINUE HERE
- [] Advanced: drawing 2D buttons anywhere on the canvas (do activity of put a dot on the page and fold to find the ratio of dimensions)
  - [] all shapes do not have to start at one coordinate (like in CS20 - CS30)
  - [] naming variables in camelCase | variables are how the computer draws the shapes after first principals are worked out
  - [] initializing or declare
  - [] populate based on display variables (identifying the pixels being used)
  
    - fast forward only: triangles only
    - next: two triangles and a partial pause shape
  - [] extra buttons: loop once (drawing text), looping infinite, looping playlist, mute (image and X), shuffle

  - [] boilerplate, draw() / shapes grouped by comment / initialize or declare / population using display variables
- [] introduce naming groups of code through TABs
  - [] Visual Data based on Display, population()
  - [] advanced: related to one point
- [] review Case Study
- [] drawing text (day and night mode inks)
- [] drawing images (tints with day and night mode)
- [] algorithms of music buttons
- [] adding features to music player
- [] display issues (CANVAS larger than display)
- [] adding meta data with ink colour

---

Future Ideas

- [] Night Mode Colors by button and default by time
  - Use of ternary operator
  - CS20 is able to use daytime procedure for more individual control
- [] Array for songs and sound effects variables

Geometry Questions
- Size must be in coded in landscape, portrait, or square initially
- Able to change these in void draw
- what happens if the CANVAS is larger than the display: shink it, etc.
